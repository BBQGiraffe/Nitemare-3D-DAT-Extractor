# Nitemare3D DAT Extractor
extracts Menu art and sounds from the 1994 FPS game Nitemare 3D

## Usage
launch the Executable and click "Select DAT file" and navigate to your Nitemare 3D folder,
click either SND.DAT or UIF.DAT,
SND.DAT will give you Midi music and Voc sound files, UIF.DAT will give you Pcx image files(can be opened with Photoshop)

these files will be extracted to C:\Nitemare

## compiling
I have included the Visual Studio project files,
you could probably port this to Linux easily(only Windows code is the GUI)

## issues
when exporting audio from the Windows version of the game, the midi comes out fine,
but the sound samples are in a format I can not Identify.
